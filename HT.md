# HYPERTHREADING / SMT

So now that you know; HyperThreading adds latency, but in some cases, more threads can make games run smoother or gain fps; but always with a latency-penalty.

---

ON = MORE FRAMES IN GAMES, POOR LATENCY. RECOMMENDED TO DISABLE IN 8+ CORE SYSTEM, TEST ON 6 CORES.

OFF = LOWEST LATENCY, FPS MAY VARY; MOUSE WILL FEEL AMAZING.
> CAREFUL WITH 8k POLLING RATES (they use a lot of cpu without HT/SMT).

6 CORES CPUs

In my personal experience, i tested two 6-cores CPU (i5-12400f & R5 5600) and now i can't game with HyperThreading enabled, mouse feels terrible in any polling rate.

In competitive shooters, where every ms matter, probably you prefer to disable it.
In Cpu games like Valorant, CS2, AimTrainers, Overwatch, Fortnite; i got more/same frames and incredible latency with HT disabled.

In more demandant games like; COD Warzone 2023, Battlefield 2042, SinglePlayer or multi-tasking with that games open, i prefer to enable HT because i got more frames (120-144avg vs 165avg).

So yeah, unless you have a 6-core CPU, disable it by default.
