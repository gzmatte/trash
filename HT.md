# HYPER-THREADING ON VS OFF
BASICALLY
ON = MORE FRAMES, POOR LATENCY. SAFE TO DISABLE IN 8+ CORE SYSTEM, TEST ON 6 CORES.
> PERSONAL EXPERIENCE; IN MY INTEL & RYZEN OF 6 CORES I HAVE IT OFF.

OFF = LOWEST LATENCY, FPS CAN BE BETTER OR LOWER DOESNT MATTER; MOUSE WILL FEEL AMAZING.
> CAREFUL WITH 4-8k POLLING RATES IN 6 CORES CPU's (they use a lot of cpu without HT).
